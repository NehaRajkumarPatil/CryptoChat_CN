# CryptoChat_CN
A secure, multi-user chat application built using raw sockets in Python with support for encrypted messaging, emoji reactions, private messages, file sharing, typing indicators, and MongoDB-based user authentication.
This is a Computer Networks Mini Project (Team 1 ‚Äì Semester 4) that implements a secure multi-user chat system using Python raw sockets. It features end-to-end encryption using SSL, real-time messaging with emojis and file sharing, typing indicators, and private messaging. User registration and login functionality are implemented using MongoDB. The project demonstrates core networking concepts such as client-server architecture, message broadcasting, and socket programming, with a focus on secure communication.
